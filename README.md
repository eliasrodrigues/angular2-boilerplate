# Angular 2 Beta Boilerplate

## Description
This repository is a very simple Angular 2 Boilerplate for my projects and was based on the repository [Angular 2 Beta Boilerplate](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/angular-2-beta-boilerplate) by **Maximilian**.
which it's derived from the official Angular 2 Documentation which can be found [here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).

A mix between the Angular 2 Beta Boilerplate and HTML5Boilerplate.
